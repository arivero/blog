					<description><![CDATA[Mitchell, it is difficult to explain this. If it were real, it could be also related to the tunneling or whatever process needed to produce fission. 

Look in the second plot I put in http://vixra.org/abs/1509.0090, the combination of W, Z and Higgs seem to justify the peaks of fission yields, so perhaps when one of the droplets has the mass of an elementary boson it is easier to break the bag.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My theory of the beta decays around the W boson mass would be that the nucleus is emitting an on-shell W boson. If the nucleus were treated as a point mass, then this would resemble the on-shell decay of top quark to bottom quark. To show nuclear structure, perhaps a skyrmion model.]]></description>
