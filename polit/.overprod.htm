<em>Abstract.</em> We compare the principles of anarchist economy with the
ones of capitalist and (&quot;real&quot;) socialist, economies. Countries under 
anarchism are expected to have a higher GNP than previous systems, but the
transition to such system is unclear.

<img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">The implementation of
an anarchist system implies strong modifications an almost every social
mechanism, as power relationships must be eliminated and each individual must be
able to develop his self as far as possible.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Because of this, anarchy theory
covers a wide range of areas beyond economy, and it is easy to misunderstand
proposals in politics or moral taking them -and mistakenly critiquizing them- as
proposals for the productive system.  <br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">The main line of thought in
anarchy economical theory is the one from Kropotkine, abstracted in the famous &quot;OK,
simply take it from the stack&quot;. Although he is unable to get an adequate
transition process to such economy, and it lacks of some minor details, it
estimates in a realistical way how an stable anarchist system would work.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">In his analysis, Kropotkine
atacks (pseudo)scientific socialism because it sloppyly translates philosophical
remarks to incorrect mathematical relations:  it is said that sometimes Marx
seems to think that every continuously raising function is linear, when he
analizes how to give &quot;to each one depending of his work&quot;. He correctly
predicts that state-organized economy, as tested in real socialism, will cause a
productivity loss because of the lack of iniciative and increasing burocratic
errors, and he even tries to warn Lenin about it, unsucessfully.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">But other hand, he coincides
with the usual leftist criticism to capitalism, where the worker is not in a
real position to time- sustained bargain, as he needs to get the essential goods
for subsistence. Note that in addition capitalism system put difficulties to a
group of individuals to start self production of some object, as access to
capital is blocked or, in the best, highly subjected to interest rates. I.e, the
owner of the capital also is able to get a &quot;plusvalia&quot; from any
self-organized work of producers, not only from individual workers.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">As alternative both to
capitalism and to planified socialism, he proposes overproduction of all the
essential goods. He correctly predicts that such overproduction will be
reachable with a work of five hours a day, which is the current level in
developed countries, and probably near the minimum. <br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Capitalism optimizes
productivity by worker, but as compensation it try to mantain production always
under the critical level of price fall. Here is where capitalism steals to
humanity: it is not giving us as many objects as industry could be able to
manufacture. <br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">For
capitalism to be able to retain production and mantain prices, it will have a
system to put off the market (either temporally or ethernally) part of the
produced objets, or part of the production tools and raw materials. Depending of
the retained object, the retention method or the duration of it, different
techniques are described in the text books: monopolist systems, trusts,
carteles, industrial closings, etcetera. All these methods are based in a only
concept: the &quot;ownership&quot; of the industry by a group of so-called
capitalists.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">So, we see
that capitalism steals to the society (call it world, or nation, or as you want)
by giving us less objects than the quantity which could be made using the
society taskforce. And we see that this stealing is effectively made by claiming
&quot;ownership&quot; at some step of the productive chain. Is in this sense
that we say that &quot;property is thief&quot;: capitalist are stealing to the
whole society. They steal when they reduce the overall production of its
industries, they steal when they associate to control market, and they steal
when they conspirate to avoid any other free association of men to go ahead and
to make the same product.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">(There is a minor sense, more
restricted, but perhaps closer to the pre-kropotkinian origin, of such phrase: &quot;Ownership&quot;
also steals by asking every worker to sell himself to get the final products he
needs, by menazing him either to lock-out the industry or to raise the final
price of the product. I think that Marx analysis made emphasis in this
microscopic -individual- stealing or &quot;plusvalia&quot;, but mathematics in
such time were too weak to sucessfully relate it to the macroscopic -global-
one, and they are yet, so marxists are not to be blamed for this specific
focus...)<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Now, giving
that capitalism works near the critical point of production of its market, this
is not so difficult to be surpassed. Even putting into account the international
trading, it would be expected that an entry into production of all the
unoccupped workers in Europe, at the same conditions that the currently working
ones, would push the whole system into the overproduction regime.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Giving the actual technological
status, with a four-five hours per day per person as dayly labor time, it seems
that overproduction would be easier to control that near-critical production, so
the anarchist system, once started, would have an easier domino expansion than
capitalism. (Some computer simulation could be interesting here too, guys;-)
This would be because other regions would turn to anarchism in order to be not
overflown by its production.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">The overcritical status of
anarchist economy must not be confused with the similarly deflactionist, but
depressive, phase of capitalist cycle. In capitalism under depression, prices
are cut down and stacks filled, but workers have not posibility to buy the
produced goods, as control of capital continues making its way. Note that a
depressive phase is characterized by a high level of unemployement while, par
contra, anarchist overproduction mantains a full employ status.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">The main problem theoretical
problem now is how to get the transition from capitalism to anarchism. It seems
that both state and property must be atacked at the same time: Historically,
attacks only to state bounced back (across fascism) to capitalism in a time
between four and fourty years (say, Mussolini or Franco). Attacks only to
property bounced back to capitalism in sixty or seventy years. By other hand,
the slow move predicated by west-socialism is really slooooowww, and the
revolutionary work class move is really minoritary (and remember that industry
must be preserved in the move). Perhaps some mutation of cooperativism or
sindicalism, able  to win capitalists in his own terrain, alone of combinated
with worker class techniques, could be devised. It is also unclear if the
transition will start in developed countries or in the ones currently
developing. Pros and contras for different economical status must be discussed
elsewhere. Lets finish this letter with a pair of remarks:
<ul>
<li>It can seem paradoxical that we claim capitalism and its variants (any one
retaining ownership) are currently underproducing, as it is the same old blame
that capitalism puts on communism by comparing gross production rates. Note that
anarchism correctly claimed that state communism would decrease strongly
productivity, probably before any capitalist theorist. Burocratic problems and
lack of iniciative were evidents in the theory, and become clearly relevants
after fifty years of practice.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">In capitalism, burocratic issues
are minor when compared with state communism, but lack of iniciative comes from
the self- protecting practices of capitalists, merely ownership. Capitalism ask
any association of producers to buy or rent capital from the owner, then slaving
them to put priority on capitalist requeriment, and not in social or market
objetives. As the producers become aware of capitalist control -which eventually
can be made explicit by ruling the company organization- their iniciative goes
down.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">(By example,
consider Apple technological innovation with and without the founders, or the
two years delay on PDA technology dued to Apple capitalism control of the ARM
chip)<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Anarchist system
completely blows away any blockings to iniciative, and then gross national
product is to be expected higher than under capitalist, ownership based,
systems. If you are unable to imagine this, try at least to imagine a
zero-interest rate mechanism, where you are entitled to give back the bank no
more than the capital they gave you. (asking in exchange to give to &quot;the
stack&quot; the rest of goods overproduced by you).</li>
<li>Count unit (money) is one of the minor details we referred to in the
beginning of this letter. It must be understood that money is a major detail in
our current economical system, when fast conversion between money and capital is
adequate to evaluate benefits of capital control. With overproduction, and
without capitalist mechanism, market is dinamited and pricings will more closely
evaluate real work. In a long range term, money could be disposed.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Due to the fast conversion
mechanism, it is a common error to identify money and capital. It is even a
common insult between economists, in the same mood than a physicist can attack
other by shooting &quot;You are confusing between heat and temperature, go back
to the school!&quot;.  This error is, voluntary or involuntary, made both by
leftist and rightist analists when critiquizing taxes, social expenses, or
military budgets... To put a example, when we ask &quot;How many doctors can be
paid with the cost of a military plane&quot; the nearest answer, &quot;the
number of engineers involved divided by the number of planes manufactured, if
you are intending to cut down all the military air industry&quot;, is almost
never got. The same kind of failures raises when a libertarianist ask to
substitute public health by private one, or to modify salary laws, based mainly
in wrong monetarist calculus.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">In the overproduction phase,
money is unidentified from capital, and its equivalence rules can be simplified,
so it could be a valuable tool for statististical estimates. From the individual
point of view, to have some money would certify your right to get from the
stack, but to accumulate a lot of money would proof unuseful: With no
possibility of capitalist trade, the interest rates would be zero or close, as
insinuated in the previous remark.<br><img src="/blog/polit/null.gif" hspace="7" width="2" height="2">Small scale experiences with a
secundary currency, non able to be converted to capital, are currently being
done in some European towns. Independently from this, and allthougth its low
significance for anarchist fundamentals, a mathematical classification of
currency systems under Kropotkinian economics would be valuable by itself, as
both capitalist and socialist economical flows could be calculated as
perturbations to the &quot;free&quot; Kropotkinian ones.</li>
