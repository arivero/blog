Dear Dr Rivero

Standard model masses and models of nuclei

I am writing to you on behalf of the Editor, Professor JT Stuart FRS, to thank you for offering your paper to Proceedings A. Unfortunately, after carefully consideration, and in consultation with another Fellow, he has decided to decline your submission as he believes it does not meet the requirements of the journal. I hope that it will be published elsewhere.

Yours sincerely

Dr T Holt
