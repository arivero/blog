Dear Dr. Rivero:

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your willingness to
address any shortcomings by clarifying the text further. Unfortunately,
I find your arguments unconvicing.  My previous concerns still stand.
In my judgement, the evidence that you provide is rather uncertain. I
therefore conclude that it has little relevance in supporting any
claims of correlated masses between fundamental and composite systems.
Hence, I cannot support considering your manuscript for publication.

If you wish to pursue the editorial process further, then I must direct
you to the usual route of appeal to a Divisional Associate Editor, via
this office. For further information, please consult the PRL editorial
policies which are available from the PRL home page at
http://prl.aps.org/.

Despite my negative response, I hope that you have a joyful holiday
season and a happy new year.
