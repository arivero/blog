Dear Dr. Rivero,

I regret to inform you that your manuscript is not considered suitable
for publication in Physical Review Letters.

The manuscript outlines a conjecture that the masses of the Higgs
particle as well as those of the weak interaction gauge particles are
correlated, to a certain degree, with the masses of certain
doubly-magic nuclei.  As you state at the end of the first paragraph of
the introduction, "...it is not the goal of this note to reveal the
answer, just we aim to state the problem."

All of the Physical Review journals (including Physical Review Letters)
emphasize fundamental physics research. You suggest that an as yet
undiscovered fundamental physics relationship is responsible for the
similarities between heavy fundamental particles and certain heavy
composite nuclei.  Unfortunately, in order for the editors to consider
your manuscript for review, it must at least demonstrate that the
underlying evidence has a high degree of certainty and that a robust
attempt has been made at exploring possible solutions in terms of
fundamental physics.  And in this regard it would have been helpful if
your manuscript had presented a convincing case why a correlation of
one property between two quite different physical systems should
require a fundamentally new physics perspective.

In view of the above we are not considering your manuscript further.

Yours sincerely,

Christopher Wesselborg
Senior Assistant Editor
