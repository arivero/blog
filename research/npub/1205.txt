Dear Dr. Rivero ,

The manuscript you submitted to Europhysics Letters  has been sent to the Editor in Chief who asked the opinion of an expert in the field. 

I regret to inform you that on the basis of the attached referee report, Professor Jerome cannot accept your manuscript for publication and therefore supports the decision of Professor Auerbach. 


        Yours sincerely,


        on behalf of  Professor D. Jerome

                Staff Editor

REPORT

The subject could have been quite interesting. However the speculation 
of the author appears to be beyond the possibility to describe nuclear 
spectra in a proper way with physical justification.
Introducing boson  masses out of the already known description of the 
IBM interacting boson model needs more sound theoretical justification.
In conclusion the article in the present  form is not recommended for 
publication.
