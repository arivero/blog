COMMENTS FROM REFEREE:

This paper is pure speculation on some near coincidences and should not be
published in MPL.
Only when he is able to say much, much,... more about the  "undetermined
many body effect" he refers to in the Abstract should the paper be
reconsidered in this physics journal.
It is not sufficient to say "It could happen", "it could be
possible", "we could be seeing" - phrases that appear near the end of the
manuscript.
