 In this letter the problem involves some different objects and it is difficult to see how a relationship can exist between them. The theoretical point point is, I believe, subtle. Nucleons orbiting (bound!) in a nucleus suffer self-energy and vertex corrections from any interacting boson. Usual rule of thumb is to forget about any boson whose mass is above the proton mass because its effect is neglectable. The paper could indicate that the procedure is incorrect, and that vertex corrections could be relevant in some situations depending of recoil mass and potential strength. But I have avoided this specific claim, limiting the article to show the experimental status. It seems honest to point out this status to the community and to let some freedom for building specific calculations.
