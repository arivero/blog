Dear Dr. Rivero,

I have looked over your manuscript, "Standard model masses and models of 
nuclei".  The qualitative style differs substantially from what we normally 
consider for a physics letter.  I do not feel it is appropriate for a 
letter journal.  I wish you good luck in finding a more suitable 
publication forum.

Sincerely yours,
Wick Haxton
Editor, Physics Letters B
