Dear Dr Rivero,


Our Supervisory Editors have assessed the paper entitled

Standard model masses and models of nuclei

by


A. Rivero

and have reached the conclusion that your paper is too speculative and
lacking in proper methodology. Therefore it falls outside the scope of
Nuclear Physics A and cannot be considered for publication.

 
Yours sincerely,

Jeanette Bakker
on behalf of the Editors of Nuclear Physics A
