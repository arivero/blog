During experiments at CERN it has occurred sometimes that an excess of events has 
been announced for a very concrete energy range, but additional statistical analysis, or 
renewed experimental input, has smoothed down the initial deviations. This author is 
aware of three such events. In 1984 the experiment UA1 got preliminary excess in the 
range of 40 GeV \cite{UA1} (see also \cite{nature}). During the mid running of LEP 2, 
experiment L3 got some excess in the range of 68 GeV \cite{L3}. And finally, perhaps 
the more popular, during the last run of LEP 2 the ALEPH collaboration, and also L3, 
got excess signal in the range around 115 GeV \cite{aleph}. 

Our purpose here is to examine if all the three signals can be linked to an unlocated 
calibration problem. It could happen if an unforeseen non-uniformity in distributing 
energy causes some background events to accumulate, simulating to be a signal. 

This problem can happen if a naive nuclear mass model is used at some point in the 
physics calculations in detectors. We all known than nuclear magic numbers, causing 
microscopical corrections in mass and level calculations, occur at Z=28, 40, 50, 82 and 
114, as well as at N=28, 50, 82, 126 and 284. It is a less know fact \cite{rivero} that the 
highly unstable nuclei, beta plus decaying, having these Z numbers have approximately, 
within a 2% or less, the same mass that the corresponding, beta minus, highly unstable 
having these N numbers.  The corresponding nuclear masses are about 45, 68, 91, 115, 
175 and 246 GeV. 

Thus if a calibration or a detector depends, say, on secondary decay from near proton 
drip-line nuclei, a  mass model taking these masses into account should be used for the 
physics of the material. The same would happens with secondary decays near neutron 
drip line, but this line is rarely reached experimentally. If simple analytic 
approximations, such as Weisaker formula, are used instead, we can expect errors to 
happen related to these mass values. As all the CERN experiments share legacy code 
both for simulations and actual calibration of measurements, it could be that such 
approximation were hidden in some shared code.

Of the four values in CERN reach, three of them correspond very accurately to the 
troubled event excesses, while the other is just under the peak of the Z0 particle, so that 
a error there should be masked under the huge quantity of real Z0 events. 

A second possibility is that CERN procedures are correct and all the three deviations 
correspond to physical events. This is a proposition a lot more unlikely  to accept 
because it implies that nuclear data to be excessively sensible to particles beyond the 
nuclear scale. But it could be claimed on grounds of the two extant masses, 175 and 246 
GeV, which do not correspond to CERN measures but are also commonly assocciated to 
high energy physics. 246 Ge could be any particle with a coupling such that its mass 
coincides with the vacuum expected value of the higgs field, and 175 GeV is the area of 
the top mass, or its associated mesons. 

Additional support for the physical reality of the excesses could be coming now from 
HERA \cite{carli} where some events have been reported about 40 GeV. A common bug 
between the code of HERA and CERN is more unlikely that between CERN 
experiments.
