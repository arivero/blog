<h2>a footnote to <i>Democritus as Taoist</i>
</h2>

<p>"Taoist" is justifyed because the article quotes the
Tao Te Ching, but perhaps it could be more appropiate to
title it "Democritus and the Yang/Yin School", because
the Yang Yin doctrine was at these times an independent
school not incoporated to the taoist corpus. Furthermore,
the (ceremonial?) fragments of the TTC found at Goudian burials do
not include chapters 11 and 14

</p>
<p>The mention in footnote 4 about Zeno paradoxes can be
concreted by searching in google by
<b>Chuang-tzu Hui Shih arrow</b>. It is dated 275 BC.

</p>
<p>To frame the atomists in Chinese cronology, perhaps it is
better to see Democritus as contemporary to Mo-Zi. Generically,
a good cross-cultural chronology is lacking, at least in the internet.
Besides greek and chinese, one should include early Budhist (the
Majhima Nikaya, late Vth century, names the four elements) and 
some hinduist (Vaisheshika Suttra, about 200 BCE, as well as
early Jainism.). An example: the dyad/triad postulation 
of volume elements is kept in the Indian tradition of atomism,
while it is lost in the western remmants. 

</p>
<p>The chronology quest must not be confused with a priority issue. 
Our real problem is that we have lost all the text of the atomists,
so we need to infer the atomic theory from contemporary references,
and here the cronology helps us to determine who these contemporary
were. It is equally important if the atomists could be quoting
them, if them were quoting to the atomists, or if there
was some cultural contact or even an  annual football match :)

</p>
<p>We should be able to use the reconstructed discussion as an 
introductory way ;) to think the modern theory. Lets give an example: 
Does "extension" pertain, as a property, to the "being" or to
the "non-being"? If the second, then particles are points, as in
current quantum field theory. If the first, then particles
are strings or branes, as in current(?) superstring theories.
