As you see, most editors avoid content, judging crackpottery from style, 
and sometimes looking for an excuse a posteriori. So improvement of the
paper from editorial comments is practically impossible
<p> 
Here, the point is subtle. Nucleons orbiting (bound!) in a nucleus
 suffer
self-energy and vertex corrections from any interacting boson. Rule
of thumb is to forget about any boson whose mass is above the proton
mass. On other hand, the system being bound, the recoil mass of the
center of force is the mass of the whole nucleus, and this could invalidate
the naive scale at the proton mass.
The paper could indicate that 
vertex or self-energy corrections are relevant in some situations.
 But I have 
avoided specific technical claims, limiting the article to show the experimental
status. It seems honest to point out this status to the community, but 
editorial procedures are against this kind of production. 

<p>In any case, one must remember that editorial procedures are just
a reflect of the community. And then wonder how have we come to this
situation.

While it is clear that spin-orbit coupling can be get for nuclear
forces by using a relativistic approach, practitioners known that the huge
spin orbit separations at big magic numbers do still need of an empirical
adjust. So I considered interesting to take a look to nuclei for magic
numbers 50, 82 and 126 by looking at the sub-shells that are responsible
of the magicity. These are, respectively, g9/2, h11/2 and i13/2.

I considered to evaluate the average weight of nuclei while they are
filling these sub-shells. As the filling happens for neutrons and protons,
this double process drives to consider rectangles. Of the possible nine
rectangles, only three touch the valley of stability, and they happen of
course near the doubly magic nuclei, ie:

A) Near P=50,N=50,
B) Near P=50,N=82, and
C) Near P=82,N=126.

Using the filing order for instance from Cottinghan/Greenwood, one sees that
the respective average number of nucleons in each rectangle
is 90, 115, and 181.

The corresponding masses show a intriguing pattern.

A) 90 amu is about 83,8 GeV, which is about a -4% of the mass of the W
                               or/and about a  8% of the mass of the Z0.
B) 115 amu is about 107 GeV, which is about a  6% of LEP Higgs Events.
C) 181 amu is about 167 GeV, which is about a  3% of the mass of the Top

Addenda 2005. I have finally got to read the pdf of 
Palazzi's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0301074">
physics/0301074</a>; la figura 3 tiene su punto para indicar
como en N=28 empieza a torcerse la cosa, pero no veo mucho
que rascar de ahi.
