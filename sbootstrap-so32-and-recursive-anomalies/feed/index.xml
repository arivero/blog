suggests that the reasoning which leads to SO(32) open string in ten dimensions (as a way to cancel gauge and gravity anomalies), can be repeated for specific compactifications. 

Meanwhile, I always thought leptons and the electroweak sector might emerge in the IR, via a Seiberg duality with a UV theory which is just quark and gluon superfields. The emergent composite fields in the IR of a Seiberg duality must obey some kind of anomaly matching. 

Actually, I&#039;m reminded of a &quot;Hanany-Witten transition&quot;, in which new branes emerge at a brane intersection, which has been a string model of some Seiberg dualities. It would be interesting if emergence of an electroweak sector could be understood that way.]]></description>
